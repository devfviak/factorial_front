## Welcome

Hi! I'm Pedro and I've developed this SPA for learning purposes

Subtly inspired in the Factorial original design :D


## Setup

Let's start by setting up the app.  
  
Clone the repo

```plaintext
git clone git@github.com:devfviak/factorial_api.git
```

  
Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```


Setup env variables. Create an _.env_  or _.env.local_ file in project root folder with the following content:   
 

```plaintext
VITE_API_URL='http://localhost:3000' # Or whichever factorial_api is running
```


## Run it
Once setup is done, you can start the server

```sh
npm run dev
```
